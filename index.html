			<p align="left">After the <a class="text_link" href="http://maplestory.nexon.net/news/8234/v-172-maple-s-eleven-patch-notes"><i>11th aniversery update (V-172 Patch)</i></a> on April 20, 2016 Nexon America Â© decided to revamp the drop rate system for Chaos Root Abyss (CRA). Before this update the "Chaos" versions of the bosses Queen, Pierre, Chicken, and Vellume would drop equips, and weapons when they died. Chaos Queen, Pierre, and Clown use to drop 5 pieces of armor equipment each kill, and Vellume would drop 3-20 weapons per kill.</p> <p> The new drop rate system works by having each boss drop equipment fragments. Each boss has its own unique equipment fragment, Queen drops fragments for hats, Pierre drops fragments for pants, Chicken drops fragments for tops, and Vellume drops fragments for weapons. You can now only get 1-17 fragments for each boss kill. To get a piece of armor, (top, bottom, and hat) you trade in 5 armor fragments for a piece of armor you desire. To get a weapon, you need to trade in 15 weapon fragments for the wepon you desire. This new drop system helps limit the amount of CRA gear in the Free Market (FM); thus raiseing the price of CRA gear. Click the image to find addtional information.</p>
