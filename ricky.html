			<main>
				<p class="palign">My name is Ricky, I have been playing Maplestory since 2008. My cousing Adam, was the person who introduced me to the game. Since I started I have made met alot of cool people. Some of the most memorable people I have meet has to be Josh, Ben, Steven, Biff, Eric, Frank, David, Mike, and Thao.</p>
				<p class="palign"> I have around 38 characters on my account, and I will provide screen shots later with all the characters. My main character is HiTzFacee. HiTzFacee is my first level 200 character. He is also my strongest character, and one of my most expensive characters. My main has two million attack range by two million attack range (2m-2m) this range allows me to kill just about every boss, and lets me hit damage cap (50 million). One of the pharses I like to say alot is "2m-2m no Clown", this pharse has two meanings to me; the first reason being it represents my attack range, and that you dont clown around while killing bosses; and the second reason is because it represents my attack range, and one of my favorite bosses is Chaos Root Abyss Clown (cra clown). This site is about the guild I lead called Increments, but I have only been in two guilds over the past five years. The other guild I was in was Delirium, Delirium was known for being one of the best guilds in the Kradia server. I stayed in Delirium for four and a half years. I left Delirium due to the leaders Beth and Loez quiting the game. Well to be honest beth got banned from the game, Delirium was also notorious for botting, dupeing, etc... Now im in Increments the guild I made with Frank, and im happy.
