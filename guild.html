			<main>
				<p class="left">On July 12, 2014 at 12:50.42 AM PST I left my old guild Delirium. I was in my Delirium for a good 4 years, and met alot of interesteing people, but it was time for a change. Me and Frank (Paperpotion) formed Increments on July 12, 2014 at 1:15.21 AM PST. We both have a equal share in the guild. We choose the name Increments to honor the diffrent stages of development our charaters take. We dont become funded over night thus we do it in increments. Some of our earliest recruits were varrious friends includeing our friend Sandy (StarryAO), MJ (Bhoss), Mustava (Fox4ever), and Steven (SnowNekos).</p>

				<p class="left">We quickly grew and soon we had a guild emblem. We recruited alot of people and soon found ourselves in the Christmas aliance. The Christmas alliance had other guilds including "Mistletoe", "Authority" (now "Gucci"), and Demoted. We grew so much that we had internal drama...and after this drama people began to leave. After they left we were told the Aliance would kick us. As soon as we left that alliance one the guildmembers I decided to fund also left.</p>

				<p class="left">I met a person named Mike who I then helped co-fund. While helping Mike co-fund I met a person named the Pizzaman (Biff). I sold Biff a Sweetwater staff for 600 million mesos, and he added me to his buddy list (BL). A few weeks later, Biff, started a aliance called Loveable; Biff added me to this newly created aliance. Loveable aliance will be one year old on May 22, 2016. The Loveable aliance consist of a few guilds, the guilds are Increments (Ricky's guild), Nocturnai (Eric's guild), Rosemary (Biff's guild), and TheLegends (Wade's guild). Here is a link to the Loveable Aliance website : <a href="http://psynergen.wix.com/loveable">Loveable</a> </p>
